# Architecture

A snapshot of how **aka** is built today, after the cache + graph rewrite. For the
product pitch and quick-start, see [README.md](./README.md). For _how it got
here_ — the staged migration from a browser-side recursive walk to a server-side
graph query — see git history; this file describes the destination, not the
journey.

## Data flow

```
Input ─▶ Extraction ─▶ Closure walk (server) ─▶ Graph view
 │          │                │                      │
 paste/     Claude via       /api/closure SSE,      identity graph +
 URL/file   /api/anthropic   one stream per act     connections panel
            (messy input     (+ per collab part)
            only)
```

1. **Input** (`src/ui/inputScreen.js`). Paste text, a URL, or a flyer/PDF/image.
2. **Extraction** (`src/core/extract.js`). Clean line-per-artist text passes
   through untouched; anything messier is sent to Claude through the
   `/api/anthropic` proxy, which returns a clean list + any alias hints. URLs are
   fetched server-side via `/api/fetch-page` (SSRF-guarded), HTML pre-cleaned by
   `src/core/cleanHTML.js`.
3. **Lookup + closure** (`src/core/lookup.js` → `/api/closure`). `lookupAll` is a
   thin **SSE client**: it splits collab names ("X vs Y") client-side and opens one
   `/api/closure` stream per act (and per part + combo), translating the streamed
   `provider` / `progress` / `budget` / `done` events back into the progressive
   callbacks the UI already consumes. The actual identity-graph walk runs on the
   server (see below).
4. **Display** (`src/ui/graphScreen.js`, `src/ui/graph/*`). Results stream into a
   live identity graph; a Lineup/Connections toggle (`viewTabs.js`) switches views.
   `devProbe.js` surfaces per-act cache/error tallies in dev builds.

## The substrate: a D1 quad store

The rewrite's core idea: a cached lookup **is** a set of graph edges, so the cache
and the graph are one store. `/api/lookup` runs search → candidate-pick → details
→ map server-side (via the pure `*.map.js` mappers, with the Discogs token / MB
User-Agent injected), then **decomposes** the mapped result into typed quads
(`src/core/quads.js`) and stores them in D1 (`server/_lib/quadStore.js`), keyed by
`source_key = ${provider}:${normalisedName}`. A read **reconstitutes** the same
blob from that lookup's quads, so the `/api/lookup` JSON is byte-identical to the
pre-graph version.

- **Predicates** (see `quads.js` for the canonical set): `aka` (identity-
  equivalent), `member_of`, `related_project`, each carrying provenance
  (provider + `sourceUrl` + `fetchedAt`).
- **Freshness.** Non-empty results get a long TTL, empties a short one. D1 has no
  TTL of its own, so an expired row's quads simply linger — which is exactly what
  enables **stale-on-error** (serve the old edges when an upstream is down). The
  flip side is no automatic GC; see TODO.md.
- **Cross-provider union.** `getQuadsTouching(key)` reads a node's edges across
  every `source_key`, so MB + Discogs finally union per node instead of being two
  separate blobs. This is what makes the closure a real cross-source graph.

## The closure query, and its hard-won rules

`server/api/closure.js` drives the walk: for each node it calls `handleLookup`
(reusing the `/api/lookup` HIT/MISS/STALE + write path) to populate the substrate,
then reads the cross-provider union and runs `identityClosure`
(`src/core/closure.js`) — the BFS re-expressed as a pure query over the quads.

The expansion **rules** are the crown jewels — re-learned slowly if ever lost — and
live as documented code, not here. The summary, with pointers:

- **Identity-only traversal.** Follow `aka` edges, and `member_of` _only_ for nodes
  that are themselves groups. Never fan a person out through their `groups` /
  `related_project` (that's "people they play with," not "the same person") — except
  when the neighbour is itself a lineup root, which is registered without a lookup.
- **Fan-out + budget caps** (`ALIAS_FANOUT_CAP`, `maxLookups`). A prolific-pseudonym
  node registers its alias names for clustering but isn't walked into; a per-root
  budget contains pathological wrong-match explosions. See `src/core/closure.js`.
- **Foreign-identity guard.** A band-less alias stub that resolves to an unrelated
  (often prolific) artist is registered for clustering but not fanned into, so one
  poisoned alias edge can't drag a whole foreign discography into the cluster.
  Rationale inline in `closure.js`.
- **Collab attribution + edge reduction** (`src/core/graph.js`). `collectRelations`
  attributes each relation to the specific combo _part_ that hosts it (`rel.owners`,
  one hop per owning part); `buildEdge` drops bridge rows that are circular noise
  (a part already shown by its own node, or a hub that is itself another lineup
  node — triangle-reduces to a star). Rationale inline in `graph.js`.

## Invariants — what should not change

These compose cleanly and everything else leans on them:

- **The provider seam.** A source is a pure `*.map.js` mapper (`pickMatch` +
  `mapDetails`) returning `{ aliases, groups, members, relatedProjects }`. The
  orchestrator never branches on provider identity; adding Wikidata is a new
  mapper plus a one-line registration in `server/api/lookup.js`, nothing else.
- **`normaliseName` + source-attributed merge** (`merge.js`). The single canonical
  key, used everywhere; cached and live edges fold together with no special-casing.
- **Progressive SSE callbacks.** `provider` / `progress` / `budget` / `done` keep
  the graph filling as data arrives; the UI never waits on the slowest node.
- **Collab splitting stays client-side.** `/api/closure` is single-root by design;
  `lookupAll` owns the "X vs Y" split and stream-merge.
- **Bindings sit behind adapters** (`server/_lib/*`). The only Cloudflare-specific
  surface is KV, D1, and the RateLimiter DO — each behind one small module — so the
  WinterCG-standard `fetch()` handler stays portable.

## Deliberately retired — do not reintroduce

The rewrite removed these on purpose; resurrecting them would undo it:

- **The browser BFS.** `expandIdentityGraph` / `enqueueFromNode` and the per-run
  session `Map` cache are gone from `lookup.js` — the walk is server-side now, the
  expansion rules live solely in `src/core/closure.js`.
- **The L1 IndexedDB cache** (`src/core/cache.js`) — the shared D1 L2 superseded it;
  `SCHEMA_VERSION` is now a single-tier key.
- **The thin browser provider clients** (`providers/{musicbrainz,discogs}.js`) and
  `fetchJson.js` — only the pure `*.map.js` mappers remain.
- **Per-provider `createQueue` pacing** (`src/core/rateLimit.js`). Global Discogs
  pacing is now the RateLimiter DO; MB stays best-effort (cache only).

## External data sources

Both lookups go through `/api/lookup`, which injects credentials server-side
(tokens never reach the browser) and shares the D1 cache across visitors.

- **MusicBrainz.** No auth; rate limit 1 req/sec. The proxy sets the descriptive
  `User-Agent` MB wants (the browser forbids that header). MB's global 1/sec stays
  **best-effort** — the per-IP cap on `/api/lookup` is abuse protection, not MB's
  limit, so concurrent cold lookups can still stampede past 1/sec; we accept that
  (gating MB would serialise big cold runs into multi-minute crawls).
- **Discogs.** Requires a personal access token; 60 req/min authenticated. Enforced
  globally by the RateLimiter DO token bucket so parallel closures can't stampede
  it. `fetchWithRetry` (honouring `Retry-After`, capped 60 s) is the backstop.
- **Transient errors.** 429 / 5xx retry with backoff + jitter; anything else
  surfaces as a provider failure — the node usually still has data from the other
  provider, and a warm re-run clears it.

## Principles & conventions

- **Scope discipline.** v1 is intentionally tight; features beyond the brief
  (accounts, Wikidata, graph viz, scraping) trigger a conversation before code.
- **One fetch per user action.** The extraction layer fetches once what the user
  explicitly asked for — no crawling, no background scraping, no robots.txt games.
- **Providers are leaves.** A mapper knows nothing about other providers, the
  cache, or the UI — see the provider-seam invariant above.
- **Progressive > complete.** First byte beats lowest latency to full results.
- **No framework.** Plain DOM, plain ES modules, plain CSS — readable within
  minutes of cloning.
- **Tests are pure + fast.** Cores are unit-tested with injected `fetchFn` / `sleep`
  and fixture captures under `tests/fixtures/` — no real timers or network. MB
  fixtures are real captures; Discogs fixtures are synthesised (tagged `_note`)
  pending a token.
